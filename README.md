## Plan Manager

The Plan Manager application is used to display and manage the schedule of an educational institution. The application has a system of groups which define permissions related to the access to particular functions of the application. The primary group is the user group, while the application also provides two additional groups, teacher and admin, which allow access to plan editing functions. It uses a ``PostgreSQL`` database to store data.
